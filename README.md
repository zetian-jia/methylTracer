*methylTracer* is an [R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29) package designed for whole-genome DNA methylation analysis. It efficiently processes [TAPS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0041-2) and WGBS data, enabling high-throughput epigenetic research. The package employs optimized storage methods for memory management, enhancing performance when handling large datasets. *methylTracer* is specifically tailored for fast detection of de-novo DMRs, making it an ideal tool for single-cell methylation analysis in biological research.
