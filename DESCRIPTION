Description: methylTracer is an R package designed for whole-genome DNA methylation analysis, 
    specifically for TAPS and WGBS data. With Rcpp acceleration, it quickly and accurately 
    identifies methylation patterns. The package based on DelayedArray storage for delayed computation, 
    optimizing memory usage and performance with large datasets. Tailored for high-throughput research, 
    methylTracer detects de-novo DMRs within seconds, making it a fast and reliable tool for single-cell 
    methylation analysis in biological research.
